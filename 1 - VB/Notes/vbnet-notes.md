# Encapsulation
- Solutions make up an application
    - group of projects that work together
    - can be heterogeneous(made of many things) 
        - you can have a project written in vb, and another in c#
    - usually characterized as you .sln files
        - this .sln file enumerates the projects that are part of the solution
- Projects group together namespaces, classes and other types
- Classes group together data and logic that go together
- Do note that encapsulation is about wrapping data and logic that go together in one unit
    - This is accomplished by: data wrapping (encaps via packaging) and data hiding (access modifiers)

# Programming with VB
